2. **Clear Symbolism**: Immediately communicates "campfire" and "gathering"
3. **Inclusive**: Shows multiple people coming together (youth, mentors, Elders)
4. **Versatile**: Works well at any size, in any color variation
5. **Unique**: Not commonly used in other youth programs
6. **Professional**: Balanced, symmetrical, confident design

### Detailed Design Specifications

- Outer circle: 100px diameter (base unit)
- Inner gathering circle of figures: 60px diameter
- Central fire: 30px height

**Fire Design:**

**Human Figures:**
- 6-8 simplified silhouettes
- Mix of sizes (suggesting youth and adults)
- Holding hands or arms raised in celebration
- Gap at the top (12 o'clock position) suggesting openness/entry point

**Cultural Pattern:**
- Subtle dot work or line pattern in the outer circle border
- Respectful, non-specific Indigenous design influence
- Not appropriating specific cultural artwork

1. Start with perfect circle using circle tool
2. Add geometric flame shapes using triangle/polygon tools
3. Use icon libraries for human silhouettes
4. Layer and arrange elements
5. Export as SVG and PNG

### Option B: Commission a Designer
**Where to Find:**
- **Fiverr**: $50-200 for logo design

## Prompt for AI Logo Generation

If using Midjourney, DALL-E, or similar:

```
"Modern, minimal logo design for CAMPFIRE youth program. Central stylized campfire with geometric flame shapes in warm orange and brown earth tones. Circle of simplified human silhouettes holding hands around the fire representing community gathering. Indigenous-inspired dot patterns in outer circle. Clean, professional, contemporary style.

Professional, empowering, culturally respectful. --ar 1:1 --v 5"
```

## Additional Logo Elements to Consider

### Logomark vs. Logotype

**Option 1: Combined Mark**
- Icon + "CAMPFIRE" text always together
- Good for: letterheads, website headers, consistent branding

**Option 2: Separate Mark & Type**
- Icon can be used alone (app icons, favicons, profile pics)
- Text can be used alone (headers, simple applications)
- Good for: versatility, modern brands

**Recommendation**: Design both, use separately or together as needed

### Tagline Integration
Consider these options:
- "Building strength through culture"
- "Mount Isa | Est. 2025"
- "Cultural Advancement & Mentoring"
- Could sit below logo or wrap around circular mark

---

## Cultural Considerations

### What TO Do:
✅ Consult with Elders and community members about design choices
✅ Use broad, non-specific Indigenous design influences (circles, dots, earth tones)
✅ Focus on universal themes: gathering, fire, community, growth
✅ Show the logo to the CAMPFIRE community for feedback
✅ Consider engaging an Indigenous designer if possible

### What NOT to Do:
❌ Don't use specific cultural symbols without permission (e.g., specific tribal patterns)
❌ Don't use sacred imagery or symbols
❌ Don't appropriate specific Indigenous artwork styles
❌ Don't use stereotypical imagery
❌ Don't finalize without community input

---

## Next Steps

1. **Review concepts** and choose your favorite direction (or combine elements)
2. **Decide on design method**: DIY, commission, or AI + refinement
3. **Create initial sketches** or mockups
4. **Get community feedback** from Elders, youth, and stakeholders
5. **Refine design** based on feedback
6. **Create final files** in all required formats
7. **Integrate into website** (I can help with this!)

```
