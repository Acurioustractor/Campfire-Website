Alright Ben, let's craft something powerful here. Based on what I'm seeing in the Kickstarter grant docs,[[1]](https://www.notion.so/Kickstarter-approved-application-253ebcf981cf8091a6d8da28c087ed59?pvs=21) CAMPFIRE is positioned beautifully as an 18-month cultural advancement and mentoring program - this website needs to honor that while making Brodie's vision crystal clear to the community.

Here's a world-class prompt you can use to kick off the website build:

## CAMPFIRE Website Development Brief

### Program Context

Create a website for CAMPFIRE (Cultural Advancement and Mentoring Program), an 18-month Indigenous-led early intervention program serving Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander youth (ages 10-17) in Mount Isa and surrounding North Queensland communities. Led by Brodie Germaine (Pita Pita Waka'i man) and supported by A Curious Tractor, this $280,000 Youth Justice Kickstarter-funded program runs from July 2025 to February 2027.[[2]](https://www.notion.so/YJ-first-kickstarter-meeting-254ebcf981cf80a88fd6f6fe570dfeb0?pvs=21)

### Core Program Elements to Showcase

- **Weekly engagement**: 52 structured group sessions blending fitness, culture, and education support at Brodie's gym
- **Quarterly on-country camps**: 3-day cultural immersion experiences led by Elders and Traditional Owners
- **Intensive mentoring**: Weekly 1-1 support, individual support plans, advocacy
- **Family connection**: Monthly family activities and cultural events
- **Pathways**: Education re-engagement, work readiness, alumni support

### Website Goals

1. **Community transparency**: Show Mount Isa what's happening - who we are, what we do, why it matters

3. **Partnership showcase**: Highlight collaboration opportunities (cultural educators, sports mentors, employers, funders)

**Ben, does this capture the vision? Happy to refine any section or expand on the storytelling/innovation pieces. The key is making sure Brodie's voice and the community's stories are at the center - not the grant, not the system, but the people and the cultural strength they're building together.**
